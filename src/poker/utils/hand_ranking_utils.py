"""
#######################################################################################################################
This implementation of a poker hand ranker assigns each hand a score, as a way to quickly compare between hands of
different ranks, and different hands of the same rank. The first digit scores the rank (e.g. Full House, Straight, etc) 
of the overall hand score. All successive digit PAIRS in the score represent certain values that may be needed to 
break ties between hands of that particular rank.  

A kicker card (tie-breaker card) is evaluated in cases where the rules of game call for one.
